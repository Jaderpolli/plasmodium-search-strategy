# Project description

This project contains the codes for obtaining the results of the article "Plasmodium sporozoite search strategy to locate hotspots of blood vessel invasion", with contributing authors Dr Pauline Formaglio , Dr Marina Wosniack , Dr Raphael Tromer , Mr Jaderson Polli , Mr Yuri Matos , Ms Hang Zhong , Professor Ernesto Raposo , Professor Marcos da Luz and Dr Rogerio Amino.

The current project was developed in colaboration between the authors, and three programming languages were used to perform better each task: R, Julia and Python.

This main folder contains three subfolders, one for each language, with instructions for running the codes and reproducing the results.

## Instructions

To run each of the analysis, open the folders and read carefully the `README.md` file of that folder.
All codes were tested in Windows 10 OS, but can be reproduced, by correctly installing packages and dependencies, either on Linux of Mac.
Each folder contains raw-data to run demos of the codes and generate the results presented on the main text.
