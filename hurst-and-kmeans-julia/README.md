# Running Hurst and k-means in Julia

    The present README file contains the instructions to run the codes in this folder, to obtain the *hurst exponent* and the *k-means clustering*.
    The hurst exponent used in the paper was calculated in Python (see **citar pasta**), but here it is also calculated separatelly in Julia, with the same qualitative results.

## Folders and organization

    This folder contains the following subfolders:

    - raw-data: containing the raw-data used for analysis;
    - src: containing the Julia modified modules for Hurst and K-means;
    - examples: containing the codes for analysing the raw-data/ files. In this subfolder, three other folders are created when running the codes inside:
        - results-hurst;
        - results-k-means;
        - results-msd;

    Now, let's see how to run everything and reproduce the results.

## Julia and package instalation

    All codes are written in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/).

    Hence, in order to run everything, you must [Download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and install properly the current stable release (in our analysis, it was used v1.7.2 -- see https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/).

    After installing Julia (and add to `PATH`), you can open Julia simply by typing `julia` in the terminal.
    Then, the following packages must be installed:

    - DelimitedFiles
    - StatsBase
    - CSV
    - DataFrames
    - CurveFit
    - Clustering

    To install a package, simply run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("PackageName")`

## Running Hurst

    To reproduce the Hurst exponent results in Julia, open Julia in this main folder, then run

    `include("examples-hurst.jl")`

    and a subfolder `examples/results-hurst` will be created with the results inside.

    Subfolder `examples/results-hurst/all` contains the individual hurst exponent for each plasmodium.

    Subfolder `examples/results-hurst/mean` contains the mean hurst exponent calculated over all individual plasmodium.

    Subfolder `examples/results-hurst/mean-type` contains the mean hurst exponent of invaders and non-invaders plasmodium separately.

## Running k-means

    To reproduce the k-means clustering, open Julia in this main folder, then run

    `include("examples-k-means.jl")`

    A subfolder `results-msd` will be created, with the mean squared displacement as a function of time for each plasmodium used to obtain the Î± exponent to be clustered.

    Finally, the subfolder `results-k-means` will be created with the results of the clustering inside for invadors and non-invadors.
